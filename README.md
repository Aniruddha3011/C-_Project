# 1. ATM System Simulation
  Class: Atm
  
  Attributes:
  balance: Holds the account balance.
  
  pin: Stores the user PIN.
  
  d, a, b: Auxiliary variables for PIN validation logic.
  
  Methods:
  Constructor: Initializes the balance with a given amount.
  
  getbal(): Returns the current balance of the ATM account.
  
  withdraw(): Handles withdrawal of money from the account, verifies the PIN (must be 4 digits), and checks if the user has sufficient funds.
  
  dipo(): Handles depositing money into the account and checks the validity of the PIN.
  
  transfer(): Allows transferring money from the account, validating the PIN and checking the balance.
  
  Main Program:
  
  A menu-driven program lets the user choose options such as checking balance, withdrawing, depositing, or transferring money.
  
  Loops until the user opts to exit.
  
  Validates PIN and ensures transactions (withdraw, deposit, transfer) are successful only with sufficient funds or valid inputs.

# 2. Color Guessing Game
  Enum: Color
  Defines 5 colors: RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, PURPLE.
  
  Methods:
  
  generateRandomColor(): Generates a random color from the enum Color using rand().
  
  colortostring(): Converts a Color enum to its string equivalent.
  
  Main Program:
  
  The user is prompted to guess the color generated by the computer.
  
  The game continues until the user guesses the correct color.
  
  Incorrect guesses result in a prompt to try again.
  
  The game uses a 3-second pause between rounds using Sleep() function to give feedback to the user.
  
  The input is converted to lowercase to make it case-insensitive.

# 3. Currency Converter System
  Class: currcon
  Attributes:
  
  Exchange rates for USD to other currencies (Euro, INR, Yuan) and vice versa.
  
  Methods:
  
  showexchangerate(): Displays the current exchange rates.
  
  Conversion methods for different currencies (e.g., usdtoeuro, eurotousd, usdtoindrupee), each converting a specified amount based on the stored exchange rates.
  
  Main Program:
  
  The user can choose from multiple currency conversion options, like converting USD to Euro, Euro to USD, Indian Rupee to USD, etc.
  
  Each conversion displays the result with a clear message, and the program uses a loop to allow continued conversions until the user opts to exit.

# 4. User Management System (Login and Registration)
  Class: user
  Attributes:
  
  username and password are stored for each user.
  
  Class: usermanager
  Attributes:
  
  A vector users stores multiple user objects.
  Methods:
  
  registeruser(): Registers a new user by taking a username and password.
  
  login(): Validates the login credentials (username and password) against the stored users.
  
  showusers(): Displays all registered users.
  
  searchuser(): Searches for a specific user by username.
  
  deleteuser(): Deletes a user by username from the list of users.
  
  Main Program:
  
  The user can choose from several options: registering a new user, logging in, viewing all users, searching for a specific user, or deleting a user.
  
  The program continues to prompt the user to choose another action after completing each task.
  
  Uses a loop for continued user interaction, providing functionality like login, search, and deletion.
